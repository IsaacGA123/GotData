# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Overview
Welcome! This repository contains my final capstone project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera.
The project focuses on using real-world data to generate insights that can support data-driven decision-making. It’s a culmination of everything I learned throughout the course — from data wrangling and analysis to visualization and storytelling.
The objective was to analyze a dataset using Python, perform data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate conclusions that help inform decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information related to [identifying survey data for trends in programing languages and databases].
