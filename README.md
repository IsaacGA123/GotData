# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. It demonstrates the full data analysis process—from understanding the business problem to delivering insights through visualizations and storytelling.

The objective was to analyze a dataset using Python, perform data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate conclusions that help inform decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information related to [briefly describe the data – e.g., real estate transactions, housing prices, etc.].  
(*Add dataset source or a link if publicly available*)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data Cleaning & Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

## Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw data using pandas
- Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover trends and outliers
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and patterns
- Generated actionable insights and final recommendations

## Visuals
*Add graphs or screenshots if applicable*

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook file in Jupyter or VS Code
3. Run all cells in order to follow the analysis workflow

## Status
